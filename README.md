## ðŸš€ Usage

### ðŸ”‚ Scrobble a Single Track

```bash
python index.py --track "PSY - Gangnam Style" --user your_lastfm_username
```

### ðŸŽµ Scrobble a Full Spotify Playlist

```bash
python index.py --playlist https://open.spotify.com/playlist/your_playlist_id --user your_lastfm_username
```

This will batch scrobble all tracks in the playlist. You can loop them too:

```bash
python index.py --playlist https://open.spotify.com/playlist/... --user your_lastfm_username --loop 5
```

## ðŸ§  Notes

- All scrobbles are timestamped as if they just happened.
- If Last.fm corrects or ignores a track, you'll see it in the output.
